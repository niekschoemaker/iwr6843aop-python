/**
 *  @b Description
 *  @n
 *        Measurement procedure for range bias estimation and rx channel gain/phase offset:
 *        1. For range bias estimation, it is assumed that the strong reflector is positioned at
 *           bore sight at distance > 1m. A peak is searched in Detection matrix,
 *           (zero Doppler range profile), in the vicinity of the expected reflector position.
 *            Range position is estimated using a three-point quadratic fit.
 *            Although the peak is estimated from detection matrix, the quadratic
 *            fit uses linear magnitude to fit.
 *        2. Compensation coefficients for the Rx channel gain/phase offset are calculated
 *           as: c[i] = conj(Rx[i])/|Rx[i]|^2 * |RxMin|, for i=0,...,numVirtualAntennas-1
 *           Rx[i] are 2D antenna symbols taken from the saved zero Doppler column of the
 *           radarCube matrix, at the range index found in step 1.
 *
 *  @param[in]  targetDistance  : Target distance in meters placed at bore sight
 *
 *  @param[in]  rangeResolution : Profile range resolution in meters per range bin
 *
 *  @param[in]  searchWinSize   : Peak search window size in meters around the expected target position
 *
 *  @param[in]  detMatrix       : Detection matrix, where the peak is searched.
 *                                The size of the matrix is R x D, where R is number
 *                                of range bins, and D is number of Doppler bins. The peak is
 *                                searched in the column zero, zero Doppler column.
 *
 *  @param[in]  numDopplerBins  : Number of Doppler bins
